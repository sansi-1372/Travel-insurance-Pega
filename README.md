automation, robotics process automation and AI. Completed missions involving Pega Express Delivery and Low Code App Builder, developing a Travel Insurance Application from scratch replete with initial phase release to future enhancements to create the apt MLP. Acquired hands-on experience in application development using Pega and JAVA to have an intriguing end-user experience design. Key learnings from Pega:  
Low-code development for faster and easier app creation,
Agile and Scrum methodology for iterative and adaptive development,
Case management for automating complex workflows,
Rule-based architecture for dynamic rule updates,
Decision management using data and analytics (essentially use of AI based CDH),
Omni-channel engagement for seamless customer interactions,
Predictive analytics for data-driven insights,
Strong security features for data protection,
Case lifecycle management for better tracking,
Integration capabilities for smooth data exchange.
Used Java and oops concepts to understand various level of inheritance, polymorphism and data abstraction and encapsulation. Also, understood the role of XML in application building. Key challenges faced in Pega application development include complexity, learning curve, performance optimization, integration, version upgrades, UX design, regulatory compliance, testing, change management, and scalability. Overcoming these challenges requires collaboration, adherence to best practices, and clear communication among teams.
